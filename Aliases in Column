What are Column Aliases in SQL?
A column alias is a temporary name assigned to a column or expression in a query. It makes the output easier to read or provides a more meaningful description. Aliases are commonly used with calculated fields or to rename columns for clarity in the result set.

Syntax

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
AS: Optional keyword used to specify the alias. You can omit it and directly provide the alias, but using AS improves readability.
Aliases are temporary and do not change the actual column name in the table.
Examples
1. Renaming a Column

SELECT name AS EmployeeName, position AS JobTitle
FROM employees;
Result:

EmployeeName	JobTitle
Alice	Manager
Bob	Developer
2. Aliasing a Calculated Column

SELECT salary, salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM employees;
Result:

salary	AnnualSalary
5000	60000
7000	84000
3. Using Aliases Without AS

SELECT name EmployeeName, position JobTitle
FROM employees;
Result:

EmployeeName	JobTitle
Alice	Manager
Bob	Developer
4. Combining Multiple Columns into One

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS FullName
FROM employees;
Result:

FullName
Alice Johnson
Bob Smith
5. Using Aliases with Aggregate Functions

SELECT AVG(salary) AS AverageSalary, MAX(salary) AS HighestSalary
FROM employees;
Result:

AverageSalary	HighestSalary
6000	7000
Important Notes
Case Sensitivity: Aliases are case-sensitive in some databases. Use quotes if the alias contains spaces or special characters.

SELECT name AS "Employee Name"
FROM employees;
Visibility: Aliases are only visible in the result set; they cannot be used in the WHERE clause. Use HAVING or a subquery instead for filtering on aliases.
