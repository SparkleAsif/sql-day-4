What are Wildcard Operators in SQL?

Wildcard operators in SQL are special characters used with the LIKE operator to perform pattern matching in string searches. 
They allow you to search for data in a table when you do not know the exact value, making your queries more flexible.

Wildcard Characters
% (Percent)

Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
Example:
'a%' matches any value starting with 'a' (e.g., 'apple', 'aardvark').
'%a' matches any value ending with 'a' (e.g., 'data', 'pizza').
_ (Underscore)

Represents a single character.
Example:
'a_' matches 'an', 'at', etc.
'a_c' matches 'abc', 'arc', etc.
[] (Square Brackets)

Matches any single character within the brackets (specific to some databases, e.g., SQL Server).
Example:
'a[bc]d' matches 'abd' or 'acd'.
'a[1-5]d' matches 'a1d', 'a2d', ..., 'a5d'.
[^] or [!] (Not Operator)

Matches any single character NOT within the brackets.
Example:
'a[^bc]d' matches 'aed' but not 'abd' or 'acd'.
Using Wildcards with LIKE
Basic Syntax

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
Examples
1. Using %
Find names that start with "Jo":

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'Jo%';
Matches: 'John', 'Joanna', 'Jordan'

2. Using _
Find names with exactly 4 characters:

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '____';
Matches: 'John', 'Mary', 'Sara'

3. Using % and _ Together
Find names that start with "J", have any single character, and then "n":

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J_n%';
Matches: 'John', 'Jenny'

4. Using [ ]
Find names that start with "A" or "B":

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '[AB]%';
Matches: 'Alice', 'Bob'

5. Using [^]
Find names that do NOT start with "A" or "B":

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE '[^AB]%';
Matches: 'John', 'Charlie'

Wildcards vs. Regular Expressions
Wildcards are simpler and limited to use with the LIKE operator.
If you need more complex patterns (e.g., starts with a vowel), consider using regular expressions (if supported by your database, e.g., MySQL's REGEXP).
Practice Exercise
Given a table students with the column name, write queries to:

Find all names containing the letter "a".
Find all names ending with "son".
Find all names with the second character "e".
