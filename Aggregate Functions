What are Aggregate Functions in SQL?
Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single result. They are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause for summarizing data, such as totals, averages, or counts.

Common Aggregate Functions
COUNT()
Returns the number of rows in a result set.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
Example: Count the number of employees in a table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees;
SUM()
Returns the sum of a numeric column.

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
Example: Calculate the total salary of all employees.

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;
AVG()
Returns the average of a numeric column.

SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
Example: Find the average salary of employees.

SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees;
MIN()
Returns the smallest value in a column.

SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
Example: Find the lowest salary.

SELECT MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;
MAX()
Returns the largest value in a column.

SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
Example: Find the highest salary.

SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;
Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY
The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, and aggregate functions are applied to each group.

Example: Total Salary by Department

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
Result:

department	total_salary
IT	150000
HR	100000
Using Aggregate Functions with HAVING
The HAVING clause filters groups based on aggregate functions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but works with aggregated data.

Example: Departments with Total Salary Greater than 120,000

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 120000;
Result:

department	total_salary
IT	150000
Combining Aggregate Functions
You can use multiple aggregate functions in the same query.

Example: Count, Minimum, and Maximum Salary by Department

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
Result:

department	employee_count	min_salary	max_salary
IT	10	3000	9000
HR	5	4000	8000
Important Notes
Null Values: Aggregate functions (except COUNT) ignore NULL values.
DISTINCT Keyword: Use DISTINCT to consider only unique values.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS unique_departments
FROM employees;
Performance: Be mindful of performance when using aggregate functions on large datasets.
Practice Exercises
Write a query to find the total number of employees, the average salary, and the highest salary in a company.
Group the employees by job title and find the total and average salary for each job title.
Find departments where the total salary exceeds 200,000.
